## Context Management Rules

1. **Read at session start** - Always read this file before starting work
2. **Update before ending** - Document what you did and what remains
3. **Commit with update** - Git commit should include WORKING.md changes
4. **Be specific** - "Fixed node drain issue" not "worked on stuff"
5. **Next action clear** - Next agent should know exactly what to do
